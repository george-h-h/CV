## George Hett

I'm a recent graduate of Makers Academy with a background in mathematics and education, looking to make the leap into software engineering. After tutoring through the uncertainty of the pandemic, now that stability has seemingly returned I believe this is the right time to pursue a career-change. I'm excited to contribute towards building technology that will help people in whatever regard that is.

## Makers Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Sportify**                 | A multi-page web app to track exercise. | MERN stack, OpenWeatherMap & Geocoding APIs |
| **Acebook**                  | A facebook clone  | MongoDB, Express, Node & Handlebars              |
| **MakersBnB**                | An Airbnb clone   | PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Ruby & ERB             |

All Makers projects were built follwing TDD.

## Work Experience

**Self-Employed** (September 2018 to May 2021)  
_Tutor of Mathematics_

- Delivered weekly sessions to over a dozen students, and saw a marked improvement in their confidence and results.
- Subtly adapted my teaching style to better suit the individual's learning needs.
- Nurtured my confidence explaining concepts to others, and developing their pattern recognition skills.

**Arm** (July 2016 to May 2017)  
_Data Science Intern_

- Early introduction to the Agile methodology, participating in daily stand-ups and biweekly sprints.
- Source control using Git, inlcuding how to resolve complicated confluence issues.
- Technologies used included Python, R and SQL.

## Soft Skills

#### Problem Solving

With a background in mathematics, I've always been interested in navigating tricky situations and finding answers to conundrums. As I've grown up, this has evolved from simply solving puzzles to helping with interpersonal issues in a professional environment, theorycrafting long-term strategy, and prioritisation of pending tasks to name a few.

#### Teamwork

When working in a team environment, I recognise that it's so important that every member feels valued and cared for. It's imperative that everybody is listened to in some capacity, and even more so that they feel comfortable and in a positive mindest. I develop good rapport with those I'm working most closely with, so that they have fun and are at their most productive during our time together. During my time studing at Makers, there were three team projects during the 12 weeks. In the planning phase for each of them, I introduced a team charter with the intent of establishing a positive team culture. It contained details on how everybody liked to be interacted with in a professional sense, what their strengths and weaknesses were, and how they wished to be supported. Feedback I recieved was in unanimous agreement that it was an extremely beneficial part of the project planning phase.

#### Leadership

Again at Makers, I rose to postions of leadership when working on the team projects. I adopted the approach of leading without dominating vocally, preferring to source opinions from around the room, and keep things organised ahead of time so my inputs were less necessary. I put a huge emphasis on emotional wellbeing. Despite these projects simply being practice runs at a bootcamp, people took them seriously and consequently the environment could sometimes get quite stressful. I successfully calmed teams down on multiple occasions, and my proactive approach avoided disagreements escalating into conflicts.

#### Receptive to Feedback



## Tech Skills

- Python, Pytest, Django
- JavaScript, Jest, Node, Express, React
- Ruby, Rspec, Sinatra
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL

### Test-Driven Development

During my time studying at Makers, every project was thoroughly tested at every juncture to assure a threshold level of quality. The process has improved my quality of code even when choosing not to write tests in my projects away from Makers, and during said projects, when getting blocked I'm able to introduce unit testing as a means of debugging more effectively. I will work quickly and efficiently whether the policy is to follow TDD or not.

### Systematic Debugging

Part of programming is being able to get back on track when things don't work as intended, and over time I have developed an excellent debugging workflow. I follow a systematic approach, which involves reading the stack trace, unit testing and gaining visibility wherever possible, aided by an intimate understanding of how the composite parts of project connect together (achieved through prior planning and research). I try to avoid having to debug often by programming with the philosophy of making the smallest possible change at each juncture that boosts functionality.

### Data-Structures & Algorithms

Utilising problem solving skills with a focus on efficiency and memory management. Versatile approach to finding the solution, with a wllingness to change approach completely, and an interest in alternative lines of thinking post facto. At Makers, I most enjoyed tackling complicated search and filter functionality issues in our projects.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2022 to May 2022)
- Pair-programmed or worked in teams every day of the 12-week bootcamp.
- Learned a new tech stack (Node & Express) from scratch in 6 weeks, to the point where I was able to produce two good quality multi-page web application in teams of people in the same situation.
- Received plenty of critical feedback from coaches which I addressed.

#### University of Sheffield (2014 to 2018)

- Mathematics, specialising in statistics.

## Hobbies

I enjoy keeping fit by running and cycling, as well as playing the piano and chess.
