## George Hett

I'm a recent graduate of the Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp who studied mathematics at university. After privately tutoring through the uncertainty of the pandemic, now that stability has returned I have decided this is the right time to pursue a career-change into software engineering. I have just less than a year's industrial experience coding - primarily in Python, and after subsequently becoming a self-led learner I have been enthralled by the process of learning new languages and technologies. When working, I'm a methodical problem solver who loves to collaborate and make development as fun as possible.

## Makers Projects

| Name | Description | Tech/tools |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| [**Sportify**](https://github.com/valentina-maggio/sportify) | A multi-page web app to track exercise | MERN stack, OpenWeatherMap & Geocoding APIs |
| [**Koala**](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/koala) | A facebook clone | MongoDB, Express, Node & Handlebars |
| [**MakersBnB**](https://github.com/ruiined/makersbnb) | An Airbnb clone | PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Ruby & ERB |

All Makers projects were built following test-driven development (TDD).

## Work Experience

**Self-Employed** (September 2018 to May 2021)  
_Tutor of Mathematics_

- Delivered weekly sessions to over a dozen students per academic year, on average improving their results by 2 grades from their predicted grades (modern GCSE scale).
- Subtly adapted my teaching style to better suit the individual's learning needs.
- Nurtured my confidence explaining concepts to others, and developing their pattern recognition skills.

**Arm** (July 2016 to May 2017)  
_Data Science Intern_

- Worked to the Agile methodology, participating in daily stand-ups and fortnightly sprints.
- Source control using Git, including how to resolve complicated confluence issues.
- Technologies used included Python, R and SQL.

## Soft Skills

#### Problem Solving

With a background in mathematics, I've always been interested in navigating tricky situations and finding answers to conundrums. As I've grown up, this has evolved from simply solving puzzles to helping with interpersonal issues in a professional environment, thinking about long-term strategy, and prioritisation of pending tasks. My approach has always been first to listen and question any other people involved, and then to take the necessary time to evaluate all viable options before arriving at a conclusion.

#### Teamwork

When working in a team environment, I recognise that it's so important that every member feels valued and cared for. It's imperative that everybody is listened to in some capacity, and even more so that they feel comfortable and in a positive mindset. I develop good rapport with those I'm working with, so that they have fun and are at their most productive during our time together. During my time studying at Makers, there were three team projects during the 12 weeks. In the planning phase for each of them, I led the development of a team charter with the intent of establishing a positive team culture. It contained details on how everybody liked to be interacted with in a professional sense, what their strengths and weaknesses were, and how they wished to be supported. Feedback I received was in unanimous agreement that it was an extremely beneficial part of the project planning phase.

#### Leadership

Again at Makers, I rose to positions of leadership when working on the team projects. I adopted the approach of leading without dominating vocally, preferring to source opinions from around the room, and keep things organised ahead of time so my inputs were less necessary. I put a huge emphasis on emotional wellbeing. With the bootcamp being so intense and condensed into a short period of time, people took the projects extremely seriously and consequently the environment could sometimes get quite stressful. I successfully de-escalated tensions on multiple occasions, and my proactive approach avoided disagreements escalating into conflicts.

#### Receptive to Feedback

I have a constant desire to improve, with a focus on receiving feedback as often as possible and taking the time to self-evaluate and action upon the key points. At Makers, there were many opportunities to receive feedback from coaches, which I took advantage of. I compiled their suggestions and started tracking my progress in the areas they had suggested I work on, and over time I saw positive results. No matter what feedback I get, I will gladly take it on board.

## Tech Skills

- Python, Pytest, Django
- JavaScript, Jest, Node, Express, React
- Ruby, Rspec, Sinatra
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL

### Test-Driven Development

During my time studying at Makers, every project was thoroughly tested at every juncture to assure a threshold level of quality. Following TDD has had no negative impacts on the speed at which I produce code, and it has dramatically reduced blockers. Furthermore, in complicated projects the presence of unit tests around the code base has made it much easier to detect and diagnose problems indirectly caused by the most recent changes elsewhere.

### Systematic Debugging

Part of programming is being able to get back on track when things don't work as intended, and over time I have developed an excellent debugging workflow. I follow a systematic approach, which involves reading the stack trace, unit testing and gaining visibility wherever possible, aided by an intimate understanding of how the composite parts of the project connect together (achieved through prior planning and research). I try to avoid having to debug often by programming with the philosophy of making the smallest possible change at each juncture that boosts functionality.

### Data-Structures & Algorithms

Utilising problem solving skills with a focus on efficiency and memory management. Versatile approach to finding the solution, with a willingness to change approach completely, and an interest in studying alternative lines of thinking after developing my own. At Makers, I found that I really enjoyed tackling complicated search and filter functionality issues in our projects.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2022 to May 2022)
- Pair-programmed or worked in teams every day of the 12-week bootcamp.
- Learned a new tech stack (Node & Express) from scratch in 6 weeks, to the point where I was able to produce two good quality multi-page web application in teams of people in the same situation.
- Sought out critical feedback from coaches which I utilised to improve my development process.

#### University of Sheffield (2014 to 2018)

- Mathematics, specialising in statistics.

## Hobbies

I enjoy keeping fit by running and cycling, as well as playing the piano and chess.
